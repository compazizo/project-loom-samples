== Project Loom - Code samples

Samples are divided by package name.

=== hello

Check the ways how to create Virtual Threads and Virtual Thread Pool

=== crash

See how JVM crash if we try to create 1_000_000 threads, and how Virtual Threads handle

=== sync_async

See how synchronous and asynchronous code look. Asynchronous scale but has disadvantages. Structured concurrency scales and don't have disadvantages in Asynchronous APIs.

=== pool

See how Virtual Thread Pools are scalable in terms of blocking operations.

=== perf

See how Virtual Threads are efficient when using blocking operations.

=== props

Hints the parallelism configuration for the Virtual Thread Pool.
